Minecraft-1.6-Forge-Modding-Tutorial
====================================
The tutorial series started on July 4, 2013.
The series is a generic series on how to mod minecraft with minecraft forge and forge mod loader as it is a way to bring more compatibility with other mods than with just ModLoader.
The source code is to be used in accordance with the videos, and not just copied and pasted, then modified as this doesn't make you lear what you are doing.
